# laravel-auth-module
This is a Module build from a great laravel modular package [nwidart/laravel-modules](https://github.com/nWidart/laravel-modules) 
<br> and use [laravel/passport](https://github.com/laravel/passport) by the way
<br> It uses Service Layer Design Pattern and help you to use it in all of your projects
<br> You can Manage all your clients including your Cookie-Tokens OR Bearer-Tokens
<br> Because of full independency we put some example for controllers but we don't use them 
inside this module and we don't suggest it to you.
## Documentation
You can fork it inside your Modules folder of `nwidart/laravel-modules` and enjoy it.
